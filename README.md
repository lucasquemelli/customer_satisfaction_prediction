# 1. Business Problem

**Introduction**

Customer satisfaction measures how products and services offered by companies and organizations meet customer expectations. This metric assists companies in managing and monitoring their business effectively and is considered an important success metric. Unhappy customers donâ€™t stay for long, nor do they voice their dissatisfaction before discontinuing services. Organizations thus need reliable and representative measures to know customer satisfaction. 

**Purpose**

---

This project aims to identify dissatisfied customers and take proactive steps to improve their happiness before it's too late.
